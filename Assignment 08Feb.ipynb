    "Ans) Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that \"what function does\" but they don't know \"how it does.\"\n",

    "Ans) Abstraction is a process of hiding unnecessary data and showing only relevant data. Out of an ocean of data, we are only maintaining the transparency of some data to the user. This important concept in object-oriented programming will reduce the complexity of the code and increases the readability.\n",

    "Ans) An abstract base class is a class that is used as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract base classes are a powerful feature in Python since they help you define a blueprint for other classes that may have something in common.Abstract base classes provide a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that don’t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. There are many built-in ABCs in Python. ABCs for Data structures like Iterator, Generator, Set, mapping etc. are defined in collections.abc module\n",
